# 🔫 AR Laser Tag Visualiser

## 👨‍💻 CG4002 Computer Engineering Capstone Project

This Unity AR application is the visualisation component of a **wireless laser tag game**, designed to deliver an immersive and hands-free mixed reality experience.

The app receives real-time game data via an **MQTT** broker hosted on a physical server (Ultra96) in the lab. This data, sent from a wearable system, includes player actions, hits, and status updates — all of which are visualised using dynamic effects in AR.

To enable stereoscopic rendering, the app uses the **Google Cardboard XR plugin**, allowing players to mount their mobile devices in a headset for a fully immersive, hands-free experience.

## ✨ Features
1. Player Actions
    - Gun shot
    - Snow bomb
    - Badminton and golf projectiles
    - Boxing and fencing animations

2. Visual Effects
    - Snow blizzard effect upon snow bomb impact
    - Shield barrier effect on players

3. AR Capabilities
    - Opponent tracking using image targets
    - Floor reference image used to anchor Unity’s world origin to a physical location in the real world

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Unity – Game engine for 3D rendering and real-time interaction.

- Vuforia Engine – AR SDK used for image tracking and anchoring.

- MQTT [library](https://github.com/gpvigano/M2MqttUnity) – Lightweight messaging protocol used to receive real-time game data from the Ultra96 server. 

- Google Cardboard XR Plugin – Enables stereoscopic rendering for mixed reality via a mobile headset.

> ❗ We have transitioned from Unity's AR Foundation to Vuforia due to the inadequate image tracking performance of AR Foundation, which could not meet our requirement of image recognition at distances of 2–3 meters.

## 🕹️ Game Rules Overview
This AR laser tag game is built around action-based interactions and real-time visual tracking. Players must remain aware of their surroundings and opponent visibility, as attacks are only considered valid hits if the opponent is visible on the player's screen during the action.

### 🎯 Player Actions
Players can perform a variety of actions, categorized as follows:

1. Gun Shooting – Fires a virtual bullet at the opponent.

2. Snow Bomb – Launches a projectile that can create a snowfall zone.

3. Sports-Based Attacks
    - Badminton Serve
    - Fencing Lunge
    - Boxing Jabs
    - Golf Swing

4. Auxiliary Actions
    - Shield Activation – Temporarily blocks incoming attacks
    - Gun Reload – Replenishes ammunition
    - Logout – Disconnects the player from the game session

### ❄️ Snow Bomb Mechanics
When a snow bomb projectile hits an opponent, it creates a snowfall area with a 1-meter radius centered on the opponent's location.

- These snowfall areas persist in the game world.
- An opponent who walks into a previously created snow zone takes snow damage.
- Additionally, any action performed by the opposing player while their target is inside a snow zone inflicts bonus damage.

This mechanic encourages spatial control, strategic movement, and the tactical use of terrain and visibility to gain an advantage.

## 📲 Installation

### 📱 Android
